# Earth Remedies 🌍

A web-based platform developed for the Microsoft Africa Imagine Hackathon that focuses on environmental awareness, carbon footprint calculation, and sustainable farming education.

## Project Overview

Earth Remedies is an educational platform designed to raise awareness about carbon emissions and inefficient farming practices that impact our environment. The platform offers tools for carbon offset calculations, weather forecasting, and provides solutions for reducing carbon emissions.

## Features

- **Carbon Footprint Calculator**: Calculate and track carbon offsetting rates
- **Weather Forecasting**: Real-time weather data and forecasting capabilities
- **Educational Resources**: Information about sustainable farming methods and environmental impact
- **Interactive UI**: Responsive design with parallax scrolling effects
- **Live Weather Updates**: 
  - Current weather conditions
  - 7-day forecast
  - Humidity and pressure data
  - Wind speed information
  - Sunrise and sunset times

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5
  - CSS3 (with Parallax effects)
  - JavaScript
- **APIs**:
  - OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
- **Font**:
  - Poppins (Google Fonts)
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Mobile-friendly layout
